				<h3>An Introduction to Asthma</h3>
				<p><span>Asthma</span> is a chronic disease that causes your airways to become inflamed, making it hard to breathe.</p>
				<p>You probably know the <span>common symptoms of asthma</span>, like shortness of breath, wheezing and coughing. But did you know there are other respiratory illnesses with similar symptoms?</p>
				<p><span>Diagnosing asthma</span> can be trickier than you think. There is no single test to determine if you have asthma. To make a diagnosis, your doctor will look at your symptoms and may perform some physical tests.</p>

					<p>In some cases, people are misdiagnosed with asthma when they actually have a different condition. Recently, Canadian researchers studied more than 600 adults diagnosed with asthma in the past 5 years. <span>They found that about one-third of them didn’t truly have asthma.</span></p>

				<h3>So what does this mean for you?</h3>
				<p class="white-span">If you are on a <span>treatment plan for asthma</span> but the treatment doesn’t seem to be working, you might not have asthma. Or you may need a different type of asthma medicine.</p>
				<p>When it comes to managing your health, you want the best treatment possible. <span>This means you have to start by getting the right diagnosis for your symptoms.</span></p>

				<h3>To get the right care, you need the right diagnosis.</h3>
				<p>It might be obvious, but for asthma treatments to work, you truly need to have asthma. If you’ve been misdiagnosed, you might be trying to treat a condition you don’t have – and at the same time possibly ignoring a condition you really have!</p>
				<p>Work with your doctor to get the right diagnosis. If you’ve been told you have asthma but have not had objective testing, see a board-certified allergist, immunologist or pulmonologist to get tested and properly diagnosed.</p>
