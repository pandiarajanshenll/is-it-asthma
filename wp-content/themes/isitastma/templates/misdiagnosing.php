				<h3>Asthma-like Conditions</h3>
				<p>Because there are so many conditions that have some of the same symptoms of asthma, it’s very important to make sure you’re getting the right diagnosis.</p>
				<p>Here are some other health issues that can cause symptoms similar to asthma:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Pneumonia</li>
					<li>Allergies</li>
					<li>Upper airway obstruction</li>
					<li>Heart failure</li>
					<li>Vocal cord dysfunction</li>
					<li>Bronchopulmonary dysplasia</li>
					<li>Cystic fibrosis</li>
					<li>Enlarged lymph nodes</li>
					<li>Lung cancer (tumors)</li>
					<li>Viral infections</li>
					<li>Sinus infections</li>
					<li>Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (emphysema or chronic bronchitis)</li>
					<li>Bronchiolitis</li>
					<li>Pulmonary embolism</li>
					<li>Recurrent cough not due to asthma</li>
					<li>Transient wheeze not due to asthma</li>
					<li>Acid reflux (gastrointestinal reflux)</li>
					<li>Obesity</li>

					<h3>Misdiagnosing Asthma</h3>
					<p>Whether you have asthma or another condition, the right diagnosis means better quality of life. Following the right treatment plan can improve your physical, mental and financial well-being.</p>
					<p>With some conditions, the right diagnosis can be the difference between life and death. Some conditions need to be treated quickly and properly. If you have been misdiagnosed with asthma, you may be using long-term medicines that are not helpful. You would not be receiving treatment for the true cause of your symptoms. Taking certain unnecessary asthma medicines (such as steroids) may be harmful over extended periods of time. Misdiagnosis can also lead to unnecessary dollars and time spent managing and treating the wrong problem.</p>
					<p>Your doctor and you both have the same goal: for you to feel well and be healthy. Partner with your doctor to verify your asthma diagnosis for better health.</p>
