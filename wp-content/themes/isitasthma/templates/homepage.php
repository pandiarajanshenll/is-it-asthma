                <p class="asthma_content"><span class="asthma_head_blue">Asthma</span> is a chronic disease that causes your airways to become inflamed, making it hard to breathe.</p>
                <p class="asthma_content">You probably know the <span class="asthma_head_blue">common symptoms of asthma</span>, like shortness of breath, wheezing and coughing. But did you know there are other respiratory illnesses with similar symptoms?</p>
                <p class="asthma_content"><span class="asthma_head_blue">Diagnosing asthma</span> can be trickier than you think. There is no single test to determine if you have asthma. To make a diagnosis, your doctor will look at your symptoms and may perform some physical tests.</p>

                <p class="what_does_content">In some cases, people are misdiagnosed with asthma when they actually have a different condition. Recently, Canadian researchers studied more than 600 adults diagnosed with asthma in the past 5 years. <span class="what_does_content_yellow"> They found that about one-third of them didn’t truly have asthma.</span></p>

            <p class="diagnosis_content">It might be obvious, but for asthma treatments to work, you truly need to have asthma. If you’ve been misdiagnosed, you might be trying to treat a condition you don’t have – and at the same time possibly ignoring a condition you really have!</p>
            <p class="diagnosis_content">Work with your doctor to get the right diagnosis. If you’ve been told you have asthma but have not had objective testing, see a board-certified allergist, immunologist or pulmonologist to get tested and properly diagnosed.</p>
